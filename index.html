          <h1>Why Pairs trading?</h1>
          <p>Pairs trading also known as market neutral, statistical arbitrage, long/short and spread trading is the most popular trading strategy amongst hedge funds. The reason being is that profit can be made regardless of market direction. Pair-trading simultaneously buys one stock while short selling another highly correlated stock when the relationship between the two stocks is "out of wack". When the stocks come back "inline" the trade is closed.</p>

Investors and traders, big and small, can benefit from allocating at least a portion of their portfolio to pairs trading.
